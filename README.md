Update Week 1 Month 2 (4/7/2024)
- Commit took too long, the commit message "message" is pure unintentional, it supposed to be "wtf commit takes so long???"
- Add how to slider (Unfinished : Slide 2 and slide 3 Image, How to slider suppose to pop after first user sign up, not user sign in)
- Edit Authentication.js 's logo and backgroundImage require path : No longer require Windows path but relative path now (yeh sorry im an idiot)
